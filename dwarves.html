      Dwarves are a moderately common Dark Race with skin like dark iron and a natural affinity for crafting. This Race is at the forefront of technology, especially integrating Magic into it. They are toughened against injury by their lifetime of dedication to working in dangerous environments, but they also naturally struggle to get along with others. Dwarves have a Racial +2 Stamina Modifier and a -1 Size modifier.
