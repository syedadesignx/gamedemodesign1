      Fey are the rarest of the Light Races and are seldom found in settlements, as most choose to remain within wildlands. They tend to be slight of build and physically weak, so most avoid physical conflict. They are, however, particularly strong with Magic. They are also known for enjoying inflicting mischief on those who have wronged them. Fey have a Racial +1 Luck Modifier and a -1 Size modifier.
