      Elves are a moderately common Light Race mostly found either in places of high culture or in the wilds. Elves have longer natural lifespans than most of the other Races, which often results in them taking more time to consider options, especially life-changing choices. This can cause them to appear aloof or disconnected at times. Elves have a Racial +1 Dexterity Modifier.
