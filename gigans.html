      Gigans are a moderately common Dark Race of gigantic beings who prefer to live in small groups or tribes that findtheir homes in large caverns. Often mislabelled as “trolls”, “ogres” or “giants”, they are only different from the other Races in their size. Gigans have a Racial +2 Size Modifier (Also giving them Encumbrance and Health). Gigans require rare, specially-made armour due to their unusual shape.
